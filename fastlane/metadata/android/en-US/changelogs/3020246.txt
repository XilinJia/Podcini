 Version 6.6.1:

* the confirm dialog is more responsive when receiving a youtube media share
* receiving a youtube media share can be dismissed by not pressing the confirm button
* in Subscriptions and FeedEpisodes views, swipe down to refresh no longer blocks UI, only shows "Refreshing" status on the info bar
* added preference "Prefer low quality on mobile" under Settings -> Playback -> Playback control, and default it to false,
	* if set true, Youtube media will use low quality audio on mobile network (which has been the default way of handling)
